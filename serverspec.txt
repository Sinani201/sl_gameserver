HOSTING

A client that wishes to start a game should send this as its first message:

	:host <playername>

if the name is invalid, the server will respond with
	
	:badname

and immediately disconnect. for each word in the game, the client sends

	<wordname> y

if the word has already been guessed, or

	<wordname> n

if the word has not been guessed yet. After each word has been sent, the client sends

	:endwords

The server will respond with

	<lobbyname>

Which is the name of this game's lobby.

JOINING A GAME

A client joining a game that has already started should send this as its first message:

	:join <lobbyname>

If that lobby does not exist, the server will respond with

	:nolobby

and disconnect. If the lobby does exist, the server will respond with

	:player <y/n> <playername>

For each player currently in the game. The <y/n> will be y if the player is in the game, or n if the player joined but later left. When all of the players have been sent, the server will send

	:endplayers

The client then sends

	<yourname>

The server will respond with

	:badname

if the name is invalid. If this name is ok, the server will send

	<word>

for each word in the game. Once all words have been sent, the server will send

	:endwords

the server will then send all of the correct words that have been attempted, using the :attempt format described below.

Then, the server will send all of the players that have voted to give up, using the format described below.

BEING IN A GAME

After attempting any word, the player sends this to the server:

	:attempt <word>

When any user attempts a word and sends it to the server, the following is sent to everyone else in the game, EXCEPT the user who attempted the word.

	:attempt <word> <playername>

When a user successfully joins a game (this happens when they get the ":ok" response from the server, the following is sent to everyone else alreadyC in the game:

	:join <playername>

When a player quits, the server will send this message:

	:quit <playername>

To vote to give up, the player sends this to the server:

	:giveup

When a player votes to give up, the following is sent to everyone else in the game, EXCEPT the user who placed the vote:

	:giveup <playername>

If a player removes their vote to give up, the above two messages should be sent, but with :ungiveup instead of :giveup.

If a player quits, they should automatically remove their vote to give up on the client side, if it was placed.  The server should not send the :ungiveup message when a player quits-- it is implied.

If everyone in the game (not including players who have left) has given up, the server sends this message to everyone in the game:

	:allgiveup

ACCEPTABLE PLAYER NAMES (should be implemented on both server and client side)
* Names may only be made up of letters and numbers
